# Web-Based-Major-Project
My final module which encapsulates all of the Web development knowledge that I had learnt over my 3 years at university which lead to me creating a website 
for the Ceredigion Museum, Wales. I was tasked with helping the Museum design a new and improved website which focused on one of the 10 * artefacts that they wanted to
show to the general public. The one I had chosen was on the Riversdale Shipping Vessel that had voyages to and from Aberystwyth, Wales. 

This website is a fully functioning website including features such as Login pages for the Museum employees which can link to a CMS (Content Management System)
as well as a game which allows for interactive play for a range of users from children to older adults.
